# Client/Server Chat using sockets

This is a client-server chat application that uses socket programming to establish the connection. I used python's socket module to implement the socket connection. The port numbers used can be adjusted to whatever you desire. 

Make sure to run chat_server.py on the host first, and then run chat_client.py on the client.
The client will send the first message, and the host will be given a chance to reply.
Type /q at any time to terminate the connection.
